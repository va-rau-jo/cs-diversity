                      Thousands of students in need. Five states with shortages of primary care physicians. One medical school trying to turn the

                      outreach, and students can find the services they need to succeed as healthcare professionals.

                  <p className="flow-text">
                    Since the 1970â€™s health professionals have known of a lack of primary care physicians
                    in the Greater Pacific Northwest region.
                    As the only accredited medical school in the area, the task fell on the UW School of Medicine
                    to solve this problem.

                    Over the next decades the School of Medicine would create the

                    areas with targeted youth outreach and medical residencies.

                    Waypoint offers students and partnering organizations a simple information hub for finding and connecting with outreach programs.

                    have to jump through hurdles just to connect and collaborate with similar offerings in their

                  <p className="flow-text">
                    The data that fuels Waypoint was created practically from scratch. We designed a method of data collection for the WWAMI
                    Inititiave that enables them to collect clean, extensive information for an ever growing number
                    of outreach programs. As more organizations provide this information, Waypoint will provide a
                    greater wealth of information.

                      Creating a robust API for accessing the data collected allows future teams to utilize its potential to the fullest.

                  <p className="flow-text">
                    Waypoint was built on the premise that good tools rely on good data. Knowing that organizational needs change, we made the
                    database that houses all of the information we've gathered available as its own tool. Through
                    our partner Seattle Data for Good, all of the details of this project and instructions for using
                    the data derived from it will be made available to an entire community of innovators who will
                    continue to help the WWAMI Initiative acheive its goal of eliminating the shortage of physicians
                    in areas of need.
