                <p> 
                    Even just exploring the different reasons for why there is such a large racial and gender gap in computer science is already controversial. I
                    will be doing this analysis from the perspective of Stuart Reges, in which he attributes the gap to biological differences between men and 
                    women. Reges and James Damore, a Google employee who was fired for trying to figure out the reason for the gender gap, were both shot down 
                    for introducing an alternate point of view. Right now the agreed upon reason for this gap is that there is "systemic oppression" and a stigma
                    that computer science is a male activity.

                <p>
                    I personally have never seen oppression or unjust treatment to someone because of their race or gender
                    in computer science. In fact, there is so much pressure on universities and companies to be more diverse that I think it is <em> benefial </em> to 
                    be a minority in computer science.
