                <p> 
                    Even just exploring the different reasons for why there is such a large racial and gender gap in computer science is already
                    controversial. This is why there has been so much backlash against Stuart Reges, a computer science professor at the University
                    of Washington, and James Damore, a former Google employee. Although I disagree with their points, rejecting and shaming their
                    ideas should not be the default reaction.
                </p>

                <h2 class="analysis_header"> Reges and Damore</h3>
                <p> 
                    In Reges’ article, he starts off by emphasizing that he is accepting of everyone in his classes and that he has advocated to get
                    more women into computer science. Reges isn’t against diversity in computer science at all, although some interpretations of his
                    article have claimed that. He is a stakeholder in this issue because teaching is his passion and he wants to see people 
                    succeed. Despite his past efforts and his very analytical explanations, several other sites have reported on his article and
                    declared it to be misogynistic. I know several people who have read the secondhand sources but I highly recommend you read his
                    original piece. In his article, he says that, “Women can code, but often they don’t want to. Why fight it? We will never 
                    reach gender parity. You can shame and fire all of the Damores you find, but that won’t change the underlying reality.” He
                    comes to this conclusion and the only actual data presented is the growing disparity in women in computer science. He is not
                    a woman in computer science, how could he possibly know this for certain?

                <h2 class="analysis_header"> Current Situation</h3>
                <p> 
                    Right now the generally agreed upon reason for this gap is that there is "systemic oppression" and a stigma that computer science
                    is a male activity. While there is no “systemic oppression,” I do believe that most people think of computer science as an
                    activity for nerdy guys and at times that culture can be overwhelming. Awareness of the problem is growing following the articles
                    from these two, and there are many ways to protect yourself from discrimination. Major tech companies like Google and Microsoft
                    are very inclusive and accepting of everyone and there are many universities throughout the United States, especially on the west
                    coast, that have much higher male/female ratios in computer science (University of Washington, UC Berkeley, etc).
                </p>

                <h2 class="analysis_header"> My Opinion</h2>
                <p>
                    I personally have never seen oppression or unjust treatment to someone because of their race or gender in computer science. In
                    fact, I think there is so much pressure on universities and companies to be more diverse that I think at times it is actually
                    <em> benefial </em> to be a minority in computer science. I am not a woman though so I can’t offer my perspective on being a
                    woman in computer science. But since this gap is such a prominent issue and people discuss it constantly, I am now much more
                    aware of how things are outside of Washington State. If I end up working in computer science outside the United States or even
                    outside Washington, I am sure to be affected. Morally, I feel obligated to spread awareness.
