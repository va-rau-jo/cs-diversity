                        This article by University of Washington principal lecturer Stuart Reges offers a different point of view on gender 
                        discrimination in computer science. He tries to offer a scientific reason for why women do not pursue computer science 
                        and why they are generally uninterested in it. There was major backlash on this article because many people interpreted 
                        it as being misogynistic. However, Reges’ argument is based purely on statistics and he has already demonstrated his
                        enthusiasm for accepting everyone into computer science and for getting more women into computer science. He mentions 
                        how more effort has been put into educating and accepting more women, yet the percentage of women entering computer
                        science has increased less than the male population. This was published very recently and will be a good starting point
                        for discussing the counterarguments against the systemic discrimination in computer science. Reges doesn’t discuss 
                        racial discrimination or encouragement of racial minorities to enter computer science, but the attitude towards gender
                        and racial discrimination are almost identical.

                        This research paper published in 2018 on the disparity between men and women in STEM fields attributes the disparity to women
                        having less need for financial independence. Countries were compared by their Global Gender Gap Index score (1 being 
                        absolute parity) and the percentage of women in STEM fields and a strong correlation was found. The higher the country’s 
                        GGGI score, the fewer women it had in STEM fields. Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Algeria had a much higher 
                        percentage of women in STEM fields than Iceland and Norway. This provides another alternate viewpoint that claims that the 
                        lack of female minorities is due to their values and lifestyle, not discrimination. Addressing the counterarguments is going
                        to be a major part of the website and disagreeing with this claim is going to be crucial.

                        Workplace sexual harassment and discrimination seems to have become a common occurrence at Uber. This source is reputable 
                        because it was published in The New York Times and the author, Wakabayashi, is a consistent reporter on tech companies. This
                        article talks about references Ingrid Avendano, a former Uber employee, and her ongoing lawsuit against Uber as well as the
                        and a 420 person collective action lawsuit that Uber was settled for $10 million. Both of these lawsuits, both are 
                        regarding sexual harassment. In Wakabayashi’s article, he mentions that the common problems that people face when they 
                        identify discrimination and harassment against them is that they have to report people higher up in the company so their 
                        and their claims are sometimes disregarded. This makes several tech companies exclusionary to female and minority groups 
                        despite there not being any difference in policy regarding race or gender.
